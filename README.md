# DEX Project

A decentralized exchange (DEX) built with Solidity, Hardhat, and a React frontend.

## Description

This project is an educational prototype demonstrating the core functionalities of a decentralized exchange (DEX). It includes:
- **Smart Contracts**: Token pair management (`DEXPair`), a router (`Router`), a staking system (`Staking`), a locking contract (`Lock`), and custom tokens (`RewardToken`).
- **Frontend**: A React interface to interact with the contracts (adding liquidity, token swaps, staking, withdrawals).
- **Deployment Scripts**: Hardhat scripts to deploy the contracts on a local network.
